## Project Repository for My Data Engineering Studies at DTU

Hello! My name is Adrian Lopez, a Data Engineering student from the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). This repository serves as a collection of the projects I am working on during my period at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The projects in this repository reflect my learning journey in the field of Data Engineering and showcase my progress and skills in this area.

## About Me

I am passionate about data and how it can be leveraged to solve complex problems and deliver insights. My interests lie in the intersection of data analysis, machine learning and software engineering. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

## Projects

The projects in this repository span a wide range of topics within Data Engineering, including but not limited to:

- Data Collection and Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling
- Big Data Technologies and Cloud Computing

Each project has its own dedicated folder and includes a detailed description of the project, the data used, the methodologies applied, and the results obtained.

## Key Learnings

Each project also includes a 'Key Learnings' section where I share my insights and what I learned from working on the project. This could include challenges faced, solutions implemented, and improvements that could be made.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore this repository, check out the projects, and use them as references. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the projects further, please feel free to reach out to me.
