Â¡Hola! I'm Adrian, an exchange student from Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid (UPM) currently enrolled in the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). I'm pursuing my final year of the Data Engineering and Systems degree, representing the first promotion of this program at UPM.

Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a platform to showcase and share the projects I am working on during my time at DTU. Throughout the academic year, I'll be posting various projects related to data engineering, systems, and more. Stay tuned for exciting updates and projects!
