## Introduction
The assignment delves into studying the Rosenbrock function, computing its gradient and Hessian, identifying local minimizers, exploring optimization methods like steepest descent, Newton's method, and BFGS, and analyzing the convergence and efficiency of these methods. The tasks involve both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using Python.

## Assignment Overview
The assignment is structured into multiple exercises, each focusing on different aspects of optimization and data fitting. Key exercises include:
1. Computing gradient and Hessian for the Rosenbrock function.
2. Demonstrating local minimizer properties for the Rosenbrock function.
3. Implementing optimization methods (steepest descent, Newton's method, BFGS) to minimize the Rosenbrock function and analyzing their convergence and efficiency.
4. Exploring convexity and concavity of a given function.
5. Applying the steepest descent method to find stationary points and analyzing convergence.
