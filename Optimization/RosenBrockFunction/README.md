# Exercise Week 5

This repository contains files related to Exercise Week 5, focusing on optimization using the Rosenbrock function.

## General Description

This project is centered around optimization using the Rosenbrock function, a common benchmark problem in optimization. The provided Jupyter notebook, `ExerciceWeek5.ipynb`, contains exercises related to optimization algorithms applied to the Rosenbrock function.

## Contents

- [`ExerciceWeek5.ipynb`](ExerciceWeek5.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing exercises for Week 5.
- [`BFGSmethod_line.py`](BFGSmethod_line.py): Python script containing the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method with line search.
- [`newton.py`](newton.py): Python script containing the Newton's method implementation.
- [`newton_line.py`](newton_line.py): Python script containing the Newton's method with line search implementation.
- [`steepestdescent.py`](steepestdescent.py): Python script containing the steepest descent method implementation.
- [`steepestdescent_line.py`](steepestdescent_line.py): Python script containing the steepest descent method with line search implementation.
- [`exercise5.pdf`](exercise5.pdf): PDF document containing exercise questions for Week 5.

## Usage

1. Download and open `ExerciceWeek5.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook environment.
2. Import the provided functions from `BFGSmethod_line.py`, `newton.py`, `newton_line.py`, `steepestdescent.py`, or `steepestdescent_line.py`.
