# Optimization and Data Fitting Course Repository

Welcome! This repository contains my coursework and projects for the Optimization and Data Fitting course at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The course focused on efficient methods for computing optimal values for the parameters in mathematical models, and it allowed me to explore available software libraries and create my own programs.

## Course Overview

The Optimization and Data Fitting course covered a wide range of topics, including:

- Numerical algorithms for convex optimization
- Least squares data fitting techniques
- Polynomial fitting
- Basis expansion
- Overfitting
- Nonlinear optimization algorithms for unconstrained optimization, such as Newton Method, Quasi-Newton, BFGS, Levenberg-Marquardt, and Gauss-Newton

The course provided a balance of theoretical understanding and practical implementation, with a particular emphasis on using MATLAB and Python for high-level programming and scientific computing.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different folders for each assignment and project. Each folder includes:

- The Python code used to solve the assignment or project
- A detailed description of the assignment or project
- The data used
- The results obtained

## Using the Repository

Feel free to browse through the folders and explore the assignments and projects. The code and methodologies can serve as references or starting points for your own projects in optimization and data fitting. If you have any questions or suggestions, or if you'd like to discuss any of the projects further, please reach out to me.
