# Cognitive Modelling Project Repository

Hello! This repository contains my work on Cognitive Modelling during my period at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as a Data Engineering student from Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM). The repository includes various projects, assignments, and resources related to Cognitive Modelling.

## About the Course

The Cognitive Modelling course at DTU covers a wide range of topics, including Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Modeling, Categorization, Information Sampling, Active Learning, and more. The course involves both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of these concepts.

## Projects

Each project within this repository is a part of the Cognitive Modelling course and represents either an extension of the homework assignments, implementing and extending an existing cognitive modelling paper, or a cognitive modelling project related to my research. Each project connects, in some way, to human mind and behavior, and includes collecting (informally) behavioral data to compare my computational model to.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured with each project having its own dedicated folder. Within each project folder, you can find:

- A detailed description of the project
- The data used in the project
- The methodologies applied
- The results obtained
- Any additional resources or references used

## Using the Repository

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as references. If you have any questions or suggestions, or if you'd like to discuss any of the projects further, please reach out to me.
